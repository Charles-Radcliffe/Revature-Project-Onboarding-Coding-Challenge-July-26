# Revature-Project-Onboarding-Coding-Challenge-July-26

##Problem 1: Problem 1: Find the Contiguous Subarray with Sum to a Given Value in an array.
Accomplished using a class named Problem 1 with a static method tht takes a value and an array and prints the subarray that has the specified value

##Problem 2: Write a program and show how to implement stack using Linked List in java.(note: implement your own linked list or use the one provided by java)
Accomplished using a class called stack that implements the methods found in the Stack Documentation on the Oracle docs page: [link](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html#search(java.lang.Object)
This implementation of a stack is configured with a specific datatype/class using the angled brackets to make the stack safer to use when iterating.
##Logic Problem: In a certain code language, if the value of CONTRACT = 56 and ‘GROWTH’ = 30, then what is the value of DISTRIBUTION?
The explaination of the solution is printed in the main function

##Main function
the main function tests each of the problems and methods that fulfill the requirements of the problems. Simply running it will show the output.
